[Trial 5 (1st March, 2014)] [FAILED]
Agenda: Implement wxButton.

1. I am using Arch Linux on which I build my project and it works very well but when I tried to build it on Ubuntu, it farted. So I fixed the build script writen in python which worked but I still haven't tested it on Arch Linux. Hope it works. I am at college BTW not at home.
2. Continuing with the current coding style, I tried implementing wxButton. It compiled without any errors but again Java as usual didn't like my code. Why is it so moody??
3. Still investigating why the code is not working.
4. I also realised Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. How could I forget that? >:(


[Trial 4 (27th February, 2014)] [SUCCESS]
Agenda: Recode everything with proper programming.

1. Recoded everything again keeping code cleanliness in mind.
2. Created two classes i.e. wxApp and wxFrame in Java which inherited their respective C++ classes.
3. Partially implemented enums and constants required by wxFrame.
4. Implemented only two function of wxFrame i.e. Center() and 
Center(int direction).
5. Started documenting the code changes. As you can see there three trials without any dates. I am kinda lazy to do this stuff.

Verdict: The code worked. Continuing with current coding style.

[Trial 3 (Date unknown)] [PARTIAL SUCCESS]
Agenda: To fix the interface file and bind wxWidgets to Java again.

1. Recoded everything. It compiled without any errors or warnings and it worked. Technical details:
Classes implemented were wxApp and wxFrame. 
All virtual function overloading was handled on the C++ side.
Java only called the start function which inturn executed the C++ code.
2. The coding style was horrible so I ditched the project again. Another reason why I ditched it was because all the virtual function overloading was implemented in C++ which was supposed to be done in Java and the current coding methodology did not allow it to be done.

Verdict: Abandoned project build because of horrible coding style.
	
[Trial 2 (Date unknown)] [FAILED]
Agenda: To create wxWidgets bindings for Java.

1. Recoded everything. It compiled without any errors or warnings but Java caught an fault outside the JVM, probably a segmentation fault. 
2. The structure of the SWIG interface file was flawed. My mistake.

Verdict: Abandoned build style.

[Trial 1 (Date unknown)] [FAILED]
Agenda: To create wxWidgets bindings for Java.

1. First implementation of the project. It was an utter failure. But that was expected.

Verdict: Abandoned project build.
